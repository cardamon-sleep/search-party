# search-party

not 100% on what the site will be but I'm seeig three things

1. a dedicated site to search_party_ (faith, history, culture study. Spot to challenge and dig in, then post like articles and resources on own research and stuff)

2. simple site just for my mist drive tape or whatever it ends up being called. I envision a brutalist design, with pictures and descriptions corresponding to each song as you go down the page

3. personal site that links to the 2 things above
